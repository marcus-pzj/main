== Introduction
Welcome to _PlanMySem_!

_PlanMySem_ is a text-based (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that targets NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar.
_PlanMySem_ automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system.

_PlanMySem_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, _PlanMySem_ utilizes minimal resources on the user’s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.

[[Features]]
== Features
This section displays the available features of _PlanMySem_ together with examples for you to refer to.

*Tagging System*

Unlike other commercial calendar/scheduling/planner software, _PlanMySem_ makes use of a tagging system to manage _slots_.

Using tags to tag _slots_ will make tasks easier for you in the future. Performing tasks such as viewing, deleting and editing _slots_ will be more efficient.

Recommended uses for tags:

1. Tag modules. E.g. "CS2113T", "CS2101".
2. Tag type of lesson. E.g. "Lecture", "Tutorial", "Lab".
3. Tag type of activities. E.g. "Sports", "Seminar", "Talk".
4. Tag difficulty of task. E.g. "Tough", "Simple", "Trivial".

*Recursion System*

Recursion facilitates quick addition of multiple _slots_, similar to Microsoft Outlook's series of appointments.

In NUS, academic semesters are split into weeks of several types. Recursion allows you to add _slots_ to these types of weeks with ease through the use of the `r/`(recursion) parameter.

*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. E.g. in `t/TAG`, `TAG` is a parameter which can be used as the name of the tag.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g in `add [l/LOCATION]`, `LOCATION` is a parameter that may be omitted.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. E.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used 0 times, or as `t/lab`, `t/lecture`, `t/tutorial` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `st/START_TIME et/END_TIME d/DATE`, then both `et/09:00 st/08:00 d/2-13-2019` and `et/09:00 d/2-13-2019 st/08:00` are acceptable.

[TIP]
You can save time by utilizing the alternate and shortcut commands. E.g. instead of using `delete`, you may also use `del` or simply `d`.

*Identifiers and Parameters*

Identifiers in _PlanMySem_ are designed to be, short and easy to memorise.
Once you are familiarised with them, they should be intuitive to use to add your parameters.
The table of Identifiers and Parameters and their descriptions (Table 1) below is useful for your reference as you jump right into grasping the system.

[TIP]
You may order identifiers and parameters in any fashion and you will still be able to achieve what you want!
So, do not bother thinking about where to place parameters as ordering does not matter, instead become more efficient and save your time!

[IMPORTANT]
Identifiers may be appended with a `n` to dictate "new". +
E.g. `nt/NEW_TAG` signifies new tags in which you want to replace existing tags with.

[CAUTION]
While table 1 shows you all the identifiers and parameters that _PlanMySem_ uses, there are some commands that do not make use of identifiers nor parameters.
The view command is one such exception that make use of keywords that must be typed in a specific order.

== FAQ
*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: In order to transfer your data to another Computer, you should:

1. Install the app on the other computer +
2. Copy _PlanMySem.txt_ from your old _PlanMySem_ folder and paste it into the new _PlanMySem_ folder. +

This will overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous _PlanMySem_ folder.
