PlanMySem is a CLI (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that targets NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar. PlanMySem automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items. Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system. Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system.

PlanMySem is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, PlanMySem utilizes minimal resources on the userâ€™s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.
